## Complete HomeKit support for the UniFi Protect ecosystem using [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io).
</DIV>
</SPAN>

`homebridge-unifi-protect` is a [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) plugin that provides HomeKit support to the [UniFi Protect](https://ui.com/camera-security) device ecosystem. [UniFi Protect](https://ui.com/camera-security) is [Ubiquiti's](https://www.ui.com) video security platform, with rich camera, doorbell, and NVR controller hardware options for you to choose from, as well as an app which you can use to view, configure and manage your video camera and doorbells.

### HomeKit Secure Video Support
HomeKit Secure Video has been a feature in HomeKit since the launch of iOS 13. It provides for several things:

  * The ability to securely record and store motion events of interest using a HomeKit hub (Apple TV, HomePod, etc.).
  * Intelligent analysis of those events for specific things like animals, people, and vehicles.
  * Facial recognition based on your own photo library for people it recognizes in your recorded motion events.
  * Granular notifications based on the analysis of those motions events (animal detected, package detected, etc.).

`homebridge-unifi-protect` fully supports HomeKit Secure Video, without the need for additional software or plugins. We use the UniFi Protect livestream API and FFmpeg to provide a seamless native user experience.

#### Configuring HKSV For UniFi Protect

  * Once you enable HomeKit Secure Video for your cameras in the Home app, you can configure the types of events and objects you're interested in recording and being informed about.
  * **Important note: You must configure HomeKit Secure Video in the Home app before it will start recording any events of any kind. [Instructions for doing so](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-security-cameras-iph7bc5df9d9/ios) are well beyond the scope of this documentation. Please look it up in the infinite guides online or ask a friend.**
  * On a technical level, HKSV asks `homebridge-unifi-protect` to maintain a buffer using the UniFi Protect livestream API. This isn't quite the same thing as RTSP, which you may be familiar with, but rather an **actual UniFi Protect API** that allows direct access to the raw livestream on the Protect controller. That video buffer is a few seconds in length - in practice, HomeKit seems to always request four seconds of history. Think of this buffer like a timeshifting DVR that's constantly keeping a small buffer of live video. When a motion event occurs, we send the buffer to HomeKit, and continue to do so as long as HomeKit requests it. Using the livestream API significantly lowers the resource demands on the Protect controller, particularly when you get beyond a few cameras. It also lowers the resource demand on the machine running HBUP, since the additional overhead of processing an RTSP stream through FFmpeg is avoided.
  * It's important to note: **HomeKit decides how long each event will be, by default**. In practice, I've seen events as long 5 or 10 minutes in high-traffic areas. HomeKit continues to record an event for as long as it thinks there's some motion of interest to the user.
  * If you place a camera in a very high traffic area, say a kitchen or a family room, and enable HKSV, you're likely going to get long motion events captured in HomeKit. It's not a bug, it's the way HomeKit Secure Video is designed. :smile:

#### Interactions With UniFi Protect Smart Motion Detection
UniFi Protect has it's own smart motion detection capabilities that [can be used](https://github.com/hjdhjd/homebridge-unifi-protect/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#motion-sensors-motion-switches-and-push-notifications) with `homebridge-unifi-protect`. When you have smart motion detection enabled and you have HomeKit Secure Video is enabled **and** configured in the Home app to record events, `homebridge-unifi-protect` is faced with a dilemma: when do I notify a user of a motion detection event?

When HKSV is enabled in the Home app, by the end user, `homebridge-unifi-protect` will not use the smart motion detection capabilities of UniFi Protect to alert you to a motion event and instead use HKSV to do so. Why? If the user has made an active decision to enable HKSV, HomeKit takes over notifications of motion events to the user.

However, if you have the smart motion detection object sensors feature option enabled, you will still receive contact sensor updates for those object types as UniFi Protect detects them. It's important to note: smart object contact sensors are not related, nor connected, to HKSV. HKSV is a bit of a black box and handles everything independently without or knowledge or ability to know what it's detected by design. It's entirely possible that the smart object sensors will detect (or not detect) a certain object that HKSV does or doesn't detect.

#### How HomeKit Secure Video Works
Apple created an elegant secure-by-default system that leverages it's home-based devices such as HomePods and Apple TVs for the heavy lifting of analyzing video to create the HKSV user experience.

  * To preserve the performance and integrity of those Apple home-based devices it uses for processing video, there are certain requirements for video event processing.
  * HKSV takes a very specifically formatted video stream and analyzes it. It typically requests the preceding four seconds of video before a motion event, followed by whatever video the camera continues to see. Think of it as a timeshifted DVR - it wants to watch the past four seconds and then continue watching until it asks to stop.
  * That stream is analyzed based on what HKSV is looking for (people, animals, etc.) and continues to capture video until HKSV feels it's got nothing *interesting* left in the video. So, someone walking past the camera, for instance, may trigger a recording of 20-30 seconds, but a group of people moving around in front of the camera may generate a much longer recorded clip.
  * That recorded video event is then sent to iCloud in an encrypted form and the alert notifications are sent to your iPhone, etc. based on whatever your notification settings.

In essence, Apple's Home hub devices are doing object recognition to decide what to alert you about. Given their realtime performance requirements and the need to scale, Apple has imposed very rigid requirements on the incoming video stream in order to get things working with a good Apple-y user experience. That allows your Apple TV to be able to analyze a motion video event while displaying that shiny 4K HDR video on your fancy television without stuttering. Why do I use that example? Because I made my Apple TV stutter constantly while developing and testing HKSV support for `homebridge-unifi-protect`. The reason we need to transcode video is because Home hubs are so very particular about what they receive when it comes to those video event clips - anything above a bitrate of 2000kbps and you quickly degrade Home hub performance. Anything that's not exactly the amount of the timeshifted buffer (four seconds!) it's looking for, and suddenly timestamps are wrong within the Home app UI when you review a recorded event.

All of the above is based on observed behavior and conversations with other people. I'm sure someone much smarter than I may eventually find more definitive or better insights into the inner workings of the black box that is HomeKit Secure Video, but I doubt Apple is going to tell us much anytime soon. ðŸ˜„

**For the best experience with HBUP and HKSV, you should run Homebridge and HBUP on decent hardware and not your several-year-old RPi or other low-power/older CPU platform. There are ways to run HBUP and HKSV on those platforms, but they are all going to compromise the user experience in various ways. The performance considerations section will provide some helpful tips, but don't expect miracles powering those 20 G4 Pros on that RPi.**

**The recommended *ideal* hardware for running HBUP for use with HKSV is an Apple Silicon-based Mac with hardware acceleration enabled within HBUP. Why not RPi 4 or other hardware? Raspberry Pi has decent (not great) hardware acceleration, but critically (as of 2024), very bug-prone software and APIs to access those hardware features, at lest when it comes to FFmpeg. Intel machines fair a bit better. Macs have great hardware *and* software support for hardware acceleration, especially with FFmpeg. Apple Silicon goes one step further by adding an additional hardware enhancement to Apple's already good hardware acceleration that further improves the quality of transcoded video. Run Homebridge natively on macOS, not using Docker or other containerization solution, due to hardware acceleration being unavailable to containers.**

#### Performance Considerations
HKSV in `homebridge-unifi-protect` works well by default if you have a decently performant and modern machine that you're running Homebridge on. The price you pay for having HKSV comes primarily in the area of CPU. HBUP *will need to transcode** any video it sends to a Home hub for analysis. **The good and bad news is that it only happens when motion is detected, which triggers an analysis cycle by the Home hub. If you have a lot of cameras and a lot of motion events, expect this to happen often and the requisite consumption of CPU.**

If you're struggling to get HKSV working in HBUP, try the following, in this order and see if it helps:

  * Try forcing HBUP to only use the lowest quality video stream as a starting point. You do this by looking for the option under the HomeKit Secure Video section of the HBUP feature options webUI.

The above recommendations should help you get up and running in most lower-powered environments.

Even if things run well in your environment, I would **strongly encourage** you to ensure you're getting the best performance you can out of HKSV and HBUP more broadly by [running HBUP in a child bridge within Homebridge](https://github.com/hjdhjd/homebridge-unifi-protect/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#homebridge).

#### Things To Be Aware Of
  * You must have the full management role enabled for the UniFi Protect local account you choose to use with `homebridge-unifi-protect`. Without it, HKSV won't work correctly or at all in most cases.
  * HomeKit hubs are quite particular about the exact format of the video it receives. We use FFmpeg to transcode the video to the exact format HomeKit is requesting. In practice, even in large camera environments, this shouldn't result in a degradation in performance. We try to match the input stream to FFmpeg as closely as we can to what HomeKit is looking for, minimizing most of the computing overhead associated with transcoding.
  * Occasional errors will occur - HomeKit hubs can be finicky at times. It's not typically something to be concerned about, and please don't open issues for infrequent errors that will be logged. As both HKSV and `homebridge-unifi-protect` continue to evolve, these will become more and more rare instances.

#### Some Fun Facts
  * I've had HKSV events run as long as 10+ minutes and they work quite well.
  * The video quality that HKSV requests can be quite a bit less than the video quality of the native UniFi Protect camera capabilities, particularly for 4K-capable cameras.
  * HKSV can almost be thought of as HomeKit camera implementation 2.0. With it comes the ability to more directly access even more capabilities of your UniFi Protect cameras, such as the camera status light which you can now modify from within the Home app.
  * UniFi Protect's own smart motion detection works as well, or better than, HKSV in my testing. It detects things much more quickly, and does a better job overall. However, there's one thing that only HKSV can do: provide tailored notifications to let you know about specific object types it's detected, individual facial recognition in your recorded motion events based on your photo library, and a Home-app-based-UI for navigating recorded motion events. And that's the tradeoff you're making. To get HKSV, you need beefier hardware and a network setup. Not generally an issue for most UniFi-centric homes.
  * No, you do not need to keep rebooting your Home hubs to make things work. The hubs are fine - they are quite robust actually, in my experience. If there's a problem, it's unlikely to be in the Home hub itself.
